```py
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6739)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.routes('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

> Note the way the get_hit_count function is written. This basic retry loop lets us attempt our request multiple times if the redis service is not available. This is useful at startup while the application comes online, but also makes our application more resilient if the Redis service needs to be restarted anytime during the app’s lifetime. In a cluster, this also helps handling momentary connection drops between nodes.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.7-alpine

WORKDIR /code

ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 5000

COPY app.py app.py

CMD [ "flask", "run" ]
```

- Build an image starting with the Python 3.7 image.
- Set the working directory to /code.
- Set environment variables used by the flask command.
- Install gcc and other dependencies
- Copy requirements.txt and install the Python dependencies.
- Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
- Copy the current `app.py` in the project to the workdir `app.py` in the image.
- Set the default command for the container to flask run.

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

The web service uses an image that’s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory. It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port, 5000. This example service uses the default port for the Flask web server, 5000.

The redis service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.
